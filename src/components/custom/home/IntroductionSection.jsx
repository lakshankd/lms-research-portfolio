            The growing need for personalized learning strategies has driven the
            development of data-driven solutions to meet the diverse needs of
            Sri Lankan university students. A key challenge lies in identifying
            optimal learning paths that align with individual capabilities,
            learning styles, and engagement behaviors to improve academic
            performance. While previous research has explored generalized
            learning models, these often fail to adapt to the specific demands
            of individual learners. Traditional strategies lack personalization,
            resulting in inconsistent learning progress. Clustering algorithms
            and predictive analysis were used to segment learners and deliver
            tailored interventions based on their behavior. The proposed system
            integrates advanced machine learning techniques to enhance student
            engagement and improve overall academic outcomes through
            personalized pathways.
